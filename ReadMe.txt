A few notes:
- The code is currently in jupy form, as I complete parts of various codes I will separate them out of the jupy file and place it into a .py file and convert it into a library. But the code works as is as long as you have a jupyter notebook.
- The code also contains various other stuff as part of being a 'playground' of sorts to learn and investigate how some libraries and toolboxes work (so bear with the clutter, I will clear it up).
- The code should work as is unless some dependencies are not installed; all dependencies' installation lines are in the jupy file but commented out, uncomment and run to install.
